# 🔍 FoundYou – AI-Powered Matchmaking for Hackathons & Startup Events

## 💡 Inspiration

At most tech events and hackathons, meaningful connections happen *by chance*. But what if attendees could **find the right collaborators before the event even starts**? We built **FoundYou** to eliminate guesswork and empower attendees to make the most of their time—by connecting them with aligned cofounders, hackers, and builders *before* day one.

## 💼 What We Built

FoundYou is an **AI matchmaking assistant** that activates *before* an event begins. When participants register, they can opt-in to our platform. FoundYou then:

* Analyzes participant goals, skills, and interests through natural conversations
* Matches them with complementary peers attending the same event
* Provides a **clear explanation** for each match (no black-box AI)
* Encourages attendees to connect early and meet up **on-site**

### Key Features
