## Usage

### Authorize the CLI

This step will auth `th` with the Toolhouse backend:

# Login into toolhouse to run and deploy agents
th login
```

### Create a New Agent

Create agents with customizable templates and configurations:

```bash
# Generate an agent with an auto-generated name
th new

# Create an agent with a custom name
th new my-agent
```

### Run Agents

Execute agents locally for testing and development:

```bash
# Run a specific agent NOTE: the .yaml extension in this command
th run my-agent.yaml
```

### Deploy Agents

Deploy agents to your production environment:

```bash
# Deploy a specific agent
th deploy my-agent.yaml
```

### RAG Commands

Manage your RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) folders and files:

```bash
# List all RAG folders
th rag ls

# List files in a specific RAG folder
th rag ls my-folder

# Create a new RAG folder
th rag create my-folder

# Add files to a RAG folder
th rag add my-folder file1.txt file2.pdf

# Delete a RAG folder
th rag rm my-folder
```

Note: to add RAG functionalities to your agent you have to make sure you also add a row to your agent file.
Example:

```yaml
#
# Your agent file content here
#
rag: my-folder
```
