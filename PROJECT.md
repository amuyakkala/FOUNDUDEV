# FoundMatch - AI-Powered Startup Matchmaking

## Inspiration
FoundMatch was born from a simple observation: great startup partnerships often happen by chance. We wanted to create a smarter way for founders to connect based on shared goals, complementary skills, and aligned visions. The AGENTIC STARTUP RAGATHON provided the perfect opportunity to build this using cutting-edge AI technology.

## What We Built
FoundMatch is an intelligent matchmaking platform that:
- Uses AI to analyze founder profiles and conversation history
- Matches founders based on complementary skills and shared goals
- Provides detailed explanations for each match
- Maintains an engaging, conversational interface

## How We Built It
- **Backend**: Python/Flask for the web server
- **AI Engine**: Groq's Llama 3.3 70B model for natural conversations
- **Frontend**: Modern HTML/CSS with responsive design
- **Data Storage**: JSON-based user profiles and chat history
- **Authentication**: Simple session-based auth for quick access

## Challenges & Learnings
The biggest challenge was balancing AI sophistication with user experience. We learned to:
